1. Please install the dependencies using environment.yml via anaconda3.
    conda env create -f environment.yml
2. Once those are installed, activate the environment.
    conda activate CAL
3. In order to run the training, run
    python training_cal.py
4. I have kept only 3 episodes here as data: 2 for training, 1 for validation.
