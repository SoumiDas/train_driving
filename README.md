1. Please install the dependencies using environment.yml via anaconda3:
    <b> conda env create -f environment.yml </b>
2. Once those are installed, activate the environment:
    <b> conda activate CAL </b>
3. In order to run the training, run
    <b> python training_cal.py </b>
4. I have kept only 3 episodes here as data: 2 for training, 1 for validation.
